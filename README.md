==================

Control your interphone from your phone. It works with
[pi-doorman](https://github.com/GianpaMX/pi-doorman)

You would need to provide your firebase configuration replace:
`app/src/main/res/values/google_services.xml` values with yours.

Then add your api key to `PiDoormanGoogleApiKey` in your gradle properties
(`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`).
